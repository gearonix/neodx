# Group and hash sprites

## Missed features of SVG in JS

Despite the all disadvantages of SVG in JS, it has some design features:

- Bundlers will chunk icon components by their usage, so we'll have a lot of on-demand chunks instead of one big sprite.
- Components will be tree-shaken, so we'll have only used icons in the final bundle.
- As we're getting JS bundle, we're always seeing up-to-date icons

## Solving problems

To solve these problems at least partially, we're providing next features:

- Grouping icons into multiple sprites by directory name
- Adding hash to sprite file name to prevent caching issues
- [Generating metadata](./metadata.md) (width, height, viewBox, and sprite file path) for runtime usage

Let's setup it:

```typescript {9,11} [vite.config.ts]
import svg from '@neodx/svg/vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    svg({
      root: 'assets',
      output: 'public/icons-sprite',
      // group icons by sprite name
      group: true,
      // add hash to sprite file name
      fileName: '{name}.{hash:8}.svg'
    })
  ]
});
```

Example of the output:

```diff
/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ left.svg
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ right.svg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ actions
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ close.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ public
+   â””â”€â”€ icons-sprite
+       â”œâ”€â”€ common.12345678.svg
+       â””â”€â”€ actions.12345678.svg
```

In the result, we will solve the following problems:

- Now all icons are grouped into multiple sprites which will be loaded on-demand
- Sprite file names contain hash to prevent caching issues

But now we don't know actual file names! ðŸ™€

Let's close this gap by learning about [metadata](./metadata.md) and [writing well-featured `Icon` component](./writing-icon-component.md)!
